Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python. The game can be played by two players, who take turns to mark the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
